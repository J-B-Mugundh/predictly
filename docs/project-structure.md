# Project Structure

The directory layout of **Predictive Calc** is organized in a way that separates concerns between model development, frontend interaction, and configuration management. Below is a breakdown of the key folders and files:

```

### Key Components

#### 1. `app.py`
This is the entry point for the **Streamlit** application. It initializes the app and renders the home page, and loads the model calculators having their pages in the `pages/` directory.

#### 2. `models/`
Each model gets its own folder within the `models/` directory, which contains all necessary files for that particular model. This includes:
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for model training and experimentation.
- **model.py**: Code defining and training the finally chosen machine learning model.
- **predict.py**: Code to load the trained model and make predictions based on user input.
- **saved_models/**: Directory where the trained model (`model.pkl`) and any preprocessing objects like scalers (`scaler.pkl`) are stored.
- **data/**: Raw datasets used for training the model.
- **modelEvaluation.py**: Scripts for model evaluation and reporting.

#### 3. `pages/`
Each model has a corresponding Streamlit page in the `pages/` folder. This page handles the frontend logic, rendering the forms for user input and displaying the prediction results. For example, the `house_price_calculator.py` page contains the interface for the house price prediction model.

#### 4. `pages/pages.json`
This file manages the configuration for all pages in the application, defining attributes such as titles, icons, model paths, and tab configurations for each calculator. This centralizes the configuration for easier updates and management of multiple pages.

#### 5. `page_handler.py`
The page_handler.py file manages the rendering of pages in the Predictive Calc application by reading configurations from the pages.json file. It dynamically loads page titles, icons, and model paths, ensuring a smooth user experience. The class integrates model prediction logic and utilizes the `FormHandler` to generate dynamic forms based on the specified configurations. It also manages multiple tabs, enhancing functionality and allowing for easy updates or additions of new models while maintaining a cohesive interface.

#### 6. `form_configs/`
The `form_configs/` folder contains JSON configuration files that define the input fields required by each model. These JSON files dictate how the forms are dynamically generated by `form_handler.py`. For example, the `house_price.json` file specifies the input fields (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.) needed for the house price prediction model.

#### 7. `form_handler.py`
This script dynamically generates the input forms based on the JSON configuration files. It maps user inputs to the model’s expected parameters and passes the data to the prediction logic.

#### 8. `docs/`
Contains the project's documentation. This is where you can find information about how the system is structured and how to contribute to the project.
